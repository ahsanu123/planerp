# üèë Introduction

ASP.NET Identity Custom Store Implementation, this repo contain of custom `RoleStoreBase`, and `UserStoreBase`, including extension to simplify registering needed service into builder `AddStandardCustomIdentityStores`.
basically we implementing _Data Access Layer_ as shown in this image. 

By default ASP.NET Identity provide Entity Framework store to manage user identity in database, but this repo try to implement identity store without entity framework, so hopefully this can make user store or role store more flexible, because we can customize identity _repository_.

frontend was built with react router v7 as _[framework](https://reactrouter.com/start/framework/installation)_ not as _[library](https://reactrouter.com/start/library/installation)_, used style was [sakura.css](https://oxal.org/projects/sakura/demo/).

application database was built up on sqlite, but its use _[SQLKata](https://sqlkata.com/docs/)_ package to generate sql query, so its flexible to change database provider as _SQLKata_ support different compiler (Sql Server, SQLite, MySql, PostgreSql, Oracle and Firebird.)

is Using AuthorizationHandler
to handle Requirement described 
by AuthorizationRequirement"

note for IAuthorizationHandler "register handler service 
with builder.Services.AddSingleton<IAuthorizationHandler, MinimumAgeHandler>();"

IAuthorizationService --> IAuthorizationHandler
IAuthorizationService --> IAuthorizationRequirement

IAuthorizationHandler --> IAuthorizationRequirement

class IAuthorizationService{
    AuthorizeAsync()
}

class IAuthorizationRequirement{
    Object ListRequirement
}

class IAuthorizationHandler{
    HandleRequirementAsync(IAuthorizationRequirement Requirement)
    HandleAsync(AuthorizationHandlerContext context)
}

## üßÆ Usage Note 

- to access super admin _endpoint_, first set environment variable `APP_SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL` to email you use, for example in linux you can type this command `export APP_SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL="caasperahsanuamala5@gmail.com"`, then you can access super admin endpoint if you logged in as `caasperahsanuamala5@gmail.com`
- there is several built in Roles as listed below
```c#
        var DefaultRoles = new List<string>()
        {
            "SuperAdmin",
            "GeneralAdmin",
            "EuropeAdmin",
            "AsiaAdmin",
            "AmericanAdmin",
        };


```
- you can access swagger at `http://localhost:5136/swagger/index.html` (port might be different)
- you can access frontend app at `http://localhost:5173/` (port might be different)
